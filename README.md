# Build a Kernel for your Device!

If you already have these:
* A linux Environment (Recommended : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
* A decent Internet Connection. 
* CPU: 2 core 2 thread is the bare minimum or else it takes an eternity to build
* RAM: 4 GB Minimum 
* Storage: SSD is better and it will build if you have HDD too.. 5 to 10 GB is a decent amount of space 
* Some Linux knowledge and Basic ideas about Git.
* You need to have the Kernel Tree. (Either fork one that is already there - brought to git by other Pro Devs - or wait for your manufacturer to release thr kernel source) 
* A GitHub Account or a GitLab account! (Preferably with the Kernel tree forked or imported)

*Yaay! You're ready to build
